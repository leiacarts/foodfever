## Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, a static webpage was incrementally converted to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, a static design that lacks accessibility was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Learning Obectives
